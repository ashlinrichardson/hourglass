### Mission
Hourglass will:
* provide reliable, focused, scalable insights into determinants and outcomes, at the speed of trust[^1]
* reveal real patterns swiftly, supporting non-technical business decision-makers with actionable situational awareness and reliable intelligence in near-real time[^2] 
* raise the bar by setting an MVP international standard for the "Storytelling with Data" concept  
* serve as a North Star in standard-setting for unconditionally objective analyses, as a support for ongoing implementation and development of diversity and inclusion initiatives incl. [GBA+](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/gender-equity/factsheet-gba.pdf) in Canada and around the world

### Feedback

[^1]: Privacy aware and tailored for specific investigation and inquiry, the opposite of a greedy data mining approach
[^2]: the application is efficient enough to lend visibility to multiple issues, concerns or phenomena, without lengthly periods for re-training
