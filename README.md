# Project Hourglass
Hourglass is an accessible, investigative tool developed in collaboration with Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research (MSFHR), Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) and University of Victoria (UVIC)

### Mission
Hourglass will:
* Provide focused, reliable, scalable insights into determinants and outcomes, at the speed of trust[^1]
* Reveal real patterns swiftly, supporting non-technical business decision-makers with actionable situational awareness and reliable intelligence in near-real time[^2] 
* Raise the bar by setting an MVP international standard for the "Storytelling with Data" concept, incl. for large geospatial data
* Serve as a North Star in standard-setting for unconditionally objective analyses, as a support for ongoing implementation and development of diversity and inclusion initiatives incl. [GBA+](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/gender-equity/factsheet-gba.pdf) in Canada and around the world

### Feedback
<!-- "This research has hit paydirt. This is a significant accomplishment."

"I will become very familiar with that tool and its potential for use by normal human beings." -->
"This is just devastating in its power and evocative brilliance.  We will want to continue to work on this."

### Technical characteristics
* Not a black box
* Pivots to changing priorities of ops managers
* A quintessentially simple, graphic depiction of events
* Meets Law of Requisite Variety[^3] without overwhelming the user
* Reliable predictions and explanations which subject matter experts can interpret
* Concise, first-principles, reusable, self contained, dependency free implementation
* Achieves the goals of Machine Learning without complex Mathematics and Statistics
* Scalable: Computing resource use requirements are directly proportional to input data volume
* Performs Data Anonymization to protect personal privacy while supporting increasing openness, transparency and accountability of public services
* Borrows critical information from fundamental physics[^4] to help understand social-science data that are still physical if not as overtly so as remotely-sensed (RS) earth-observation (EO) data, for example 

## Inputs
Hourglass operates on multiple heterogeneous database tables[^5] that must be timestamped. Moreover each table must include an attribute shared among the tables and providing linkage, such as an anonymized identifier.
