# Hourglass
An accessible, investigative tool developed in collaboration with the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research (MSFHR), the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) and the University of Victoria (UVIC)

### Mission
Hourglass will:
* provide focused, reliable, scalable insights into determinants and outcomes, at the speed of trust[^1]
* reveal real patterns swiftly, supporting non-technical business decision-makers with actionable situational awareness and reliable intelligence in near-real time[^2] 
* raise the bar by setting an MVP international standard for the "Storytelling with Data" concept  
* serve as a North Star in standard-setting for unconditionally objective analyses, as a support for ongoing implementation and development of diversity and inclusion initiatives incl. [GBA+](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/gender-equity/factsheet-gba.pdf) in Canada and around the world

### Feedback
<!-- "This research has hit paydirt. This is a significant accomplishment."

"I will become very familiar with that tool and its potential for use by normal human beings." -->
"This is just devastating in its power and evocative brilliance.  We will want to continue to work on this."

### Technical characteristics
* not a black box
* pivots to changing priorities of operations managers
* a quintessentially simple, graphic depiction of events
* meets Law of Requisite Variety[^3] without overwhelming the user
* reliable predictions and explanations which subject matter experts can interpret
* concise, first-principles, reusable, self contained, dependency free implementation
* achieves the goals of Machine Learning without complex Mathematics and Statistics
* scalable: Computing resource use requirements are directly proportional to input data volume
* performs Data Anonymization to protect personal privacy while supporting increasing openness, transparency and accountability of public services
* borrows critical information from fundamental physics[^4] to help understand social-science data that aren't overtly physical as remotely-sensed (RS) earth-observation (EO) data for example 

## Inputs
Hourglass operates on multiple heterogeneous database tables[^5] that must be timestamped. Moreover each table must include an attribute shared among the tables and providing linkage, such as an anonymized identifier.

[^1]: Privacy aware and tailored for specific investigation and inquiry, not a greedy data mining approach
[^2]: the application is efficient enough to lend visibility to multiple issues, concerns or phenomena, without lengthly periods for re-training     
[^3]: "Only variety can master variety, reducing disturbances and promoting harmonious order. Regulation is then possible only if the regulating system is as various and flexible (responsive to changes) as the system to be regulated." Introduction to Cybernetics (1956) by W. Ross Ashby
[^4]: drawing inspiration from the [Light Cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone) we need both time and space to tell a story!
[^5]: Such as within the BC Data Innovation Program that operates a secure environment for citizen-centred, longditudinal research supporting best-outcomes
